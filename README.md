# Braille Plate & Cylinder STL Generator 🎯

**Create professional, tactile braille business cards and 3D cylindrical objects with 3D-printable embossing plates**

This web application generates STL files for 3D-printable braille embossing and counter plates. Simply enter your text, and the system automatically translates it to braille and creates the precise 3D models needed for cylindrical braille objects or traditional flat business-card plates.

## 1. What You'll Make

| Shape | Components | Purpose |
|-------|------------|---------|
| **Business Cards (Flat)** | Embossing Plate + Counter Plate | Traditional flat business cards with raised braille dots |
| **Cylinders** | Cylinder Shell + Counter Plate | 3D cylindrical objects with curved braille surface |

**Business Card Process**: Place paper between plates → Apply pressure → Get professional braille cards!
**Cylinder Process**: Print cylinder with integrated braille dots for 3D tactile objects!

> Vocabulary for experts: Emboss = male/positive, Counter = female/negative.

## 2. Things You Need

| Item                         | Notes |
|------------------------------|-------|
| Computer (Win/Mac/Linux)     | Install **OpenSCAD** (free) & your favourite slicer (Cura, PrusaSlicer, etc.) |
| 3-D printer                  | 0.4 mm nozzle, PLA or PETG filament recommended |
| Clamp / small arbor press    | To squeeze the plates together (even a hand-screw clamp works) |
| Business-card paper          | Use the exact card stock you plan to distribute |
| Digital calipers *(optional)*| Helpful for measuring dot size after your first test |

## 3. 5-Minute Quick-Start (Cylinder-first)

### Web Application (Recommended)
1. **Local dev**: run `python backend.py` and open `http://localhost:5001`
2. **Vercel**: connect repo and deploy; serverless entry is `wsgi.py`
2. **Enter your text** (up to 4 lines)
3. **Select braille grade** (Grade 2 recommended for most users)
4. The default **Output Shape** is **Cylinder**. Click **Generate**.
5. **Download** and 3D print your cylinder (or counter plate).
6. If you need the **Universal Counter Plate**, generate it once. You only need to re-download it if you change Expert Mode settings that affect dot geometry or spacing. Changing the text only affects the emboss plate.
7. To make flat plates, open **Expert Mode** and change **Output Shape** to **Flat Card**.

### For Business Cards:
- Print both emboss and counter plates
- Place card stock between plates
- Apply firm, even pressure
- Check results and iterate if needed

> **Tip** Always test with the same paper thickness you’ll use later.  Paper controls the final dot height more than the plastic settings do.

## 4. Video Tutorial

A short screen-recording + live demo will be published here:
`👉 [YouTube link – coming soon]`

The video covers:
1. Opening the design & entering text
2. Selecting Grade 2 vs 1
3. Exporting STL, slicing, printing
4. Assembling the full tool
5. Embossing a card & inspecting results

---

## 5. Understanding Grade 1 vs Grade 2

*Regulatory guidance in the US, UK, and elsewhere says use **Grade 2** for English braille by default.*  Grade 1 (uncontracted) is normally reserved for:
- Education / literacy teaching
- Short labels where contractions could confuse
- Situations prescribed by local regulations

Therefore the Customizer defaults to **Grade 2**.

## 6. Why the Default Sizes?  (Dots, Spacing & Sources)

The design aims to **shape the *paper* dots** so they land near widely-accepted targets for paper embossing.

Recommended on-paper dimensions (Specification 800 §3.2):

| Parameter                                             | Target |
|-------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| Dot height                                            | 0.019 in (0.48 mm) |
| Dot base diameter                                     | 0.057 in (1.44 mm) |
| Dot-to-dot distance *within a cell* (horiz/vert)      | 0.092 in (2.34 mm) |
| Cell-to-cell distance (centre-to-centre)               | 0.245 in (6.20 mm) |
| Line spacing (centre-to-centre of nearest dots)       | 0.400 in (10.16 mm) |

> *Important* Because card stock varies, *your* embossed dots may be slightly larger or smaller.  That’s normal—start with defaults, then adjust.

## 7. Test → Measure → Adjust (Recommended Workflow)

| Step | What to do |
|------|------------|
| 1. Print a **small test plate** | One or two words is enough |
| 2. **Emboss** a single card | Even, firm pressure |
| 3. **Inspect** | Feel the dots; use calipers if available |
| 4. **Adjust parameters** using Expert Mode | See table below |
| 5. **Re-print & re-test** | One or two iterations usually nails it |

### 🔄 Cylinder Shape Parameters

**Create 3D cylindrical objects with curved braille surfaces:**

| Parameter | Purpose | Typical Range |
|-----------|---------|---------------|
| **Diameter** | Cylinder width | 20mm - 50mm |
| **Height** | Cylinder length | 30mm - 100mm |
| **Cutout Radius** | Interior polygonal hole | 0mm - 15mm |
| **Seam Offset** | Rotation adjustment | 0° - 360° |

**Use Cases:** Tactile learning tools, decorative objects, cylindrical labels, educational models

Common tweaks (plates & cylinders):

| Symptom | Try this |
|---------|----------|
| Dots too flat | Increase **Dot Height** or press harder |
| Dots feel sharp | Increase **Apex Rounding** or lower Dot Height |
| Cells crowd | Increase **Cell Advance** or reduce **Dot Diameter** |
| Plates stick together | Increase **Counter Offset** or add small **Draft** |
| Cylinder text wraps | Reduce diameter or shorten text |

## 8. Printing Tips

- **Material** PLA is fine; PETG is tougher.  Use 3–4 perimeters and 40 % infill for stiffness.
- **Orientation** Print plates *flat* on the bed, embossed surface facing *up*.
- **Quality** A slower outer-wall speed (≲ 30 mm/s) produces smoother dots.

---

## 9. Safety & Handling

- Keep fingers clear of the clamp/press.
- Emboss with controlled force; over-pressing can tear paper or squash dots.

---

## 10. File-Naming & On-Part Labels (Optional but Handy)

Example STL names:
- `BRL_EmbossPlate_Raised_UEB-G2_88x51mm_Dot0p6.stl`
- `BRL_CounterPlate_Recessed_Universal_88x51mm.stl`

Engraved rim labels avoid mix-ups: **EMBOSS (RAISED) — MIRRORED** vs **COUNTER (RECESSED)**.

## 11. Acknowledgments

Huge thanks to **Tobi Weinberg** for kick-starting the project and introducing me to Cursor AI.  Without Tobi’s time, effort, and encouragement this program would not exist.

Attribution: This project was originally based on
[tobiwg/braile-card-generator](https://github.com/tobiwg/braile-card-generator/tree/main) and further evolved from my earlier variant
[BrennenJohnston/braile-card-generator](https://github.com/BrennenJohnston/braile-card-generator/blob/brennen-dev/README.md) (branch `brennen-dev`).

## 13. Developer Notes

- Backend: single Flask app in `backend.py` used both locally and on Vercel via `wsgi.py`.
- Frontend: served from `templates/index.html` with static assets in `static/`.
- Translation: browser-side Liblouis via web worker `static/liblouis-worker.js` and tables under `static/liblouis/tables/`.
- Endpoints: `/liblouis/tables`, `/generate_braille_stl`, `/generate_counter_plate_stl`.

### Local development
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python backend.py  # opens http://localhost:5001
```

### Vercel deployment
- Project uses `vercel.json` and `wsgi.py` with `@vercel/python`.
- Install step: `pip install -r requirements_vercel.txt` (smaller footprint for serverless).
- Static liblouis tables are bundled and loaded on-demand from `static/liblouis/tables/` in a web worker.
